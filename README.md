# etch-a-sketch
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-sketch.

## Additional Features
The Odin Project intended for this to be quite simple: drawing would occur upon hover. After looking at other people's submissions, I was inspired to improve upon this, instead making it draw on click-and-drag, which was a fun challenge. I also decided to add a simple colour palette to make it a more useful drawing tool, as well as a save button. The latter led to research into the html2canvas library.

## After-thoughts
This was a fun liitle project, and I felt excited to work on it and add additional features as well! It helped me reinforce some of the things learned in the course, including basic DOM manipulation as well as some simple transitions.
